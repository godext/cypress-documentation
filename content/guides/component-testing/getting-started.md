⚠️ The Cypress Component Testing library is in still in **Alpha**. We are rapidly developing and expect that the API may undergo breaking changes. Contribute to its development by submitting feature requests or issues [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/).

Welcome to the future of cypress testing. Component testing.

## What is Component Testing

Testing components is almost identical to normal cypress testing except

- We do not navigate to a page to run the tests against so no `cy.visit()`
- Instead, cypress provides a blank canvas where we can `mount` our components in isolation.

Let's get you set up so you can start testing components.

## Try it out with an existing project

If you just want to see it working but don’t want to write code, follow these steps:

<!-- FIXME: update the url of the example repo we choose -->

- Clone the calc repo
- Install depenedencies `yarn`
- Open component testing runner `yarn cy:open`

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/component-testing/first-open.png" alt="Splash Screen of Component Testing" ></DocsImage>

- Click on one of the specs and see it run
- Open the spec file by clicking on its name above the command log
- Make a change to the spec and see it re-run
- Open the component tested and make a change, any change. The test will be re-run automatically.

## Set it up in your project

This section will show you how to set a project up from scratch that has component testing running alongside e2e testing.

Before we start testing components let's make sure we everything we need.

If you are using VueJs click on the Vue tab of the code examples.

### Prerequisites

- An npm project with a `package.json` file at the root that runs on webpack 4 or 5. Create-react-app runs on webpack. It will work fine. So does Nextjs or Gatsby.
- A `webpack.config.js` file or a way to access it. Refer to the docs tof your framework to access it.
- A few components that have a visual part to them. It could be a Date Picker, tabs, responsive images, your imagination (and your time) is the limit.
- A basic knowledge of how to write tests in cypress

### Install

First, run the following command. It will install both the latest version of cypress and the tooling you need to run component testing.

<CodeGroup>
  <code-block label="react" active>

```bash
yarn add cypress @cypress/react @cypress/webpack-dev-server
```

  </code-block>

  <code-block label="vue">

```bash
yarn add cypress @cypress/vue @cypress/webpack-dev-server
```

  </code-block>
</CodeGroup>

### Configuration

Now that we have the necessary tools installed let's configure our tests.

In the same folder as `package.json` create a `cypress.json` file and a `cypress` directory of it does not already exists. in this folder create a `support.js` file.

The `cypress.json` file will allow us to configure where the component test files are.
In the following configuration all components test files are in the `src` directory and match the glob given in the `testFiles` key.

```json
{
  "componentFolder": "src",
  "testFiles": "**/*spec.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
}
```

Then it is time to fill in the `support.js` file to configure our component server.

Since our project uses webpack, we will be using webpack-dev-server to facilitate the matching of the styling and display rules of component

<Alert type="info">

If you have a dev and a production config, prefer the dev version for now, it will give you better location information using sourceMaps.

</Alert>

```js
const { startDevServer } = require('@cypress/webpack-dev-server')
const projectsWebpackConfig = require('../../webpack.config.js')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('dev-server:start', (options) =>
    startDevServer({ options, projectsWebpackConfig })
  )
  return config
}
```

We are now ready to start testing our components.

### Writing Component Tests

We assume a `button` component exists.

- Navigate to where this component file is saved
- Create a `Button.spec.jsx` file in the same folder
- Add a test:

<CodeGroup>
  <code-block label="react" active>

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { mount } from '@cypress/react'
import Button from './button'

it('Button', () => {
  mount(<Button>Test button</Button>)
  cy.get('button').contains('Test button').click()
})
```

  </code-block>

  <code-block label="vue" active>

```jsx
import { mount } from '@cypress/vue'
import Button from './button'

it('Button', () => {
  mount(() => <Button>Test button</Button>)
  cy.get('button').contains('Test button').click()
})
```

  </code-block>
</CodeGroup>

- Open Cypress Component Testing

```
yarn cypress open-ct
```

- Select the spec in the sidebar. You should see the following:

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/component-testing/one-spec.png" alt="Single Spec file with single test run" ></DocsImage>

- Try modifying the spec, make the test fail, etc. the tests re-run instantly with visual feedback.

### Setup CI

Sometimes, we want to run tests without interactivity and see all results in the terminal.
To run all tests in one command we use `cypress run-ct`.

In the project we just built, this command will yield the following results.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/component-testing/run-result.png" alt="Result of headless test run" ></DocsImage>

To make the component tests part of your continuous integration pipeline, add a script running `cypress run-ct` to travis, circle or appveyor the same way you would add a `cypress run` script without needing to start your server first. We take care of that for you.
